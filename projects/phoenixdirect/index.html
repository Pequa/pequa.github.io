   <h1>PHOENIX DIRECT</h1> 
   <br>     
   <p>Phoenix Direct is a direct-to-consumer fulfillment agency that allows companies to sell products directly to consumers through catalogs and the web. Their services include web design, web/email marketing, web development, photography, catalog design, and fulfillment services. I have worked in the web design department at Phoenix since 2013.

   <h3>EMAIL & WEB DESIGNS</h3> 
   <br>     
   <p>At Phoenix, we have several primary clients for whom we design and manage websites and email marketing campaigns. In my time in the web department, I have designed many emails for these clients whose needs range across a broad spectrum of styles and markets. This includes everything from graphical promotion emails, to product marketing emails, to transactional and text emails. In addition to designing emails, I also frequently mockup changes to their websites to send to the client to approve before the changes are implemented. <br><br>
       Both the email and web graphic design processes involve constant feedback from the clients, incorporating their needs and desired changes throughout the process. Each email and website update has strict deadlines, so I am constantly working within timelines for multiple projects at a time. I typically use Photoshop or Fireworks to design the emails and website changes, but I also occasionally build/code the emails and websites themselves in Dreamweaver.

   <p>I have included a sample of email designs above. However, I have a large portfolio of this graphic design work that is available to share with you personally upon request.

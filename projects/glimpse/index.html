    <h2>A MODDER’S DILEMMA</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Modifying cars is an ever-growing culture within many automotive brand communities, and jumping into it can come with a lot of uncertainty. If you want to modify your car, it can be hard to visualize how new parts will look when installed. If you don’t have the editing skills to mock up different changes, it can very hard to confidently design the look of your car and explore all the different possibilities. <br><br> In addition, it can be hard to get feedback on your design before you’ve paid for the parts and taken the time to install them, which is especially important considering how expensive many automotive parts are. To help solve this problem, I created Glimpse, a place to connect to a modding community and a convenient platform to preview mods on your current car.	</p>

    <h2>FILLING YOUR GARAGE</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>You can start with Glimpse by creating a profile and adding your current car to your garage. Your garage is a home base for your build, making it easy for people to see what your car currently looks like, and a great place to show off everything you’ve done so far. You can add any mods you currently have, have a record of your performance stats, photos, and even describe the history with your car. </p>

    <h2>CONNECTING TO THE COMMUNITY</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>In order to get feedback on designs, or even just to ask technical questions of people who own similar cars, Glimpse connects you to a community of fellow modders and provides a platform to interact with them. You can make friends and ask their opinions on your mods, give your opinion on theirs, view their garage, keep up with what mods they’ve recently installed, and even see what local events the community is putting on, as well as get inspiration from highlighted builds from across the community.</p>

    <h2>MAKING IT YOURS</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Previewing mods or designs doesn’t mean much unless you’re seeing the changes on your actual car. To achieve this, Glimpse uses your phone’s camera while you walk around the perimeter of your car, and uses the data to “scan” your very car in to the app. From there, it creates a 360° interactive view of your car within the app so you can start tinkering with changes from every angle.</p>

    <h2>TAKING A GLIMPSE</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>With your car imported into the app, you can use Glimpse to start previewing potential changes right on your phone without actually having to purchase and install the parts. You can preview different paint colors, vinyls and decals, wheels, and even see how performance mods will affect your stats. Glimpse allows you to create infinite combinations, allowing you to find the ones that you want for your build.</p>

    <h2>GETTING A SECOND OPINION / INTEGRATED SHOPPING</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Once you have a design that you’re happy with, it can be helpful to get a second opinion before buying parts. By using Glimpse to post your design to the community, you can get not only a second opinion, but access to the opinion of an entire community. After you get feedback and you’re ready to purchase parts, integrated shopping within the app allows you to buy the very parts that you used in your preview, letting you turn your preview into reality.</p>

    <h2>BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>To start the process of creating Glimpse, I created a list of everything the app needed to do. I laid out a flow of how I wanted the features of the app to work together, and created a mockup of each screen in Photoshop. After I had each of the features and their respective screens completed, I used (the still in beta) Adobe XD to bring everything together into one cohesive flow and prototype the app. The app can be found and downloaded 
<a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/797ec9f8-b1d1-4933-6267-d4958b3ae913/">HERE</a> to try out the prototype for yourself.</p>

    <h2>THE POSTER</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>With the prototype complete, I created a brand poster for Glimpse that showed off the context of the app, an outline of the app’s functions, and gave a feel for what <br> the brand’s style would look like. The poster will be featured alongside other select Georgia Tech projects in a design expo put on by Modern Atlanta this summer.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>Glimpse was my senior capstone studio project, and in addition to being very pleased with how the project turned out myself, I recieved a tremendous amount of positive feedback from reviewers. One reviewer said that Glimpse married the beauty of Photoshop to Instagram, and that it would likely be well received in the automotive modding market, but that they were also excited that it could be applied to other popular customization-heavy markets such as motorcycles or skateboards.</p>

   <h1>ERGONOMIC HAND RAKE</h1> 
   <br>     
   <p>The goal of this project was to design and mock up an ergonomic garden tool, which in my case was a hand rake. We were to assess problems with existing garden tools currently on the market, determine their shortfalls, and create a more comfortable, efficient solution, centered around ergonomics and hand size variation.

   <h3>RESEARCHING THE HAND</h3> 
   <br>     
   <p>To design a tool that comfortably fits the hand, I wanted to know what makes the hand comfortable. I researched average hand dimensions, grip positions, and neutral hand angles that would keep the hand comfortable during use. I decided that the rake was going to be used mainly by women, and that most of the use would occur while wearing a glove. So, I chose to aim the general dimensions of the rake to fit comfortably in the 95th percentile hand size for women, and the 50th percentile hand size for men. In other words, a rake that would fit the average woman with a glove on, while still fitting the average man.

   <h3>BENCHMARKING CURRENT PRODUCTS</h3> 
   <br>     
   <p>To continue my research, I took my ideal comfortable dimensions and angles and compared them to real products currently on the market. At the home improvement store, I found multiple hand rakes, as well as other tools that used similar handles. I took note of things such as how much flexion the handle caused, and whether or not the hand was comfortable overall.

   <h3>IDEATING FORMS</h3> 
   <br>     
   <p>I sat down and shelled out 20 different designs to lay out a broad spectrum of forms and shapes that I could potentially pursue. I made sure to keep in mind the general dimensions and positions I gathered from my research, as well as what I had learned from the benchmarking of existing products.

   <h3>NARROWING DOWN</h3> 
   <br>     
   <p>After sifting though all of my research and my 20 preliminary designs, I eliminated 
forms that were uncomfortable, strenuous, and impractical. I narrowed the designs down to five potential forms and drew up quick orthographics to help get a better idea of each of them.

   <div class=paisley>       
   <div class=text>
   <h3>MOCKING UP FORMS</h3> 
   <br>     
   <p>From the orthographics, I mocked up rough pink foam models of the five so I could visualize and actually feel them in 3D, rather than just flat on paper. I had people with various hand sizes hold and feel each of the forms to get their opinions and help further rule out uncomfortable designs.
       <p>

   <div class=text>
   <h3>CHOOSING THE FORM</h3> 
   <br>     
   <p>The form that stuck out most for me was the curved handle with the thumb grip, as it looked good, was the most comfortable, and got the most positive feedback while testing. So I took that design and fine-tuned the dimensions one last time according to the research I had gathered to make sure it met my general target audience’s hands and was as ergonomic as possible. I then made final orthographics of it to get ready for construction.

   <div class=text>
   <h3>THE ROUGH MODEL</h3> 
   <br>     
   <p>Even though I had the two-dimensional dimensions worked out, I made sure to make a rough model of the final 3D form so that I could confirm that the dimensions were correct and everything was indeed still comfortable. It also gave me an opportunity to fine tune all the kinks and small details in the form, and additionally, to help me practice techniques for final construction.

   <div class=text>
   <h3>CONSTRUCTING THE FINAL MODEL</h3> 
   <br>     
   <p>At this point, I moved on to the final sign foam model. I cut the sign foam with a band saw, filed it down to a rough shape and sanded it down to it’s final form. The prongs were a bit challenging. I purchased 1/4” clear acrylic rod, and then made a mold in the negative of what I wanted the shape to be, heated up the rods in the vacuum former, and then draped them over the mold and let them cool. I attached the three prongs to each other with acrylic glue, and then attached them to the handle with epoxy. I chose navy blue as the color for the handle because it stands out from typical colors in the garden, while still maintaining a gender and age-neutral look. I painted the prongs silver to simulate metal, and finally, added a white stripe down the middle to add more contrast to the handle.

   <p>The final model finished quite well, and I was definitely happy with how polished and sturdy it ended up being. In the final review, it received very positive feedback from both classmates and external reviewers. The handle fit almost every hand it was held by, and people liked not only how it felt, but also how it looked. When the project was all said and done, I was very pleased with how the rake turned out.

   <h1>BESPOKE CHAIR</h1> 
   <br>     
   <p>The goal of this project was to design and build a wooden chair that was custom made for our client. <br> My client was Ben Katz, a friend and fellow student in my studio class. For our design, we were only allowed to use a single 5'x8' sheet of half-inch plywood, and were not allowed to use any fasteners or glue.

   <h3>ANALYZING NEEDS </h3> 
   <br>     
   <p>The general idea that Ben gave me for the chair was similar to some current gaming-style chairs that are currently on the market: small, low to the floor, comfortable, and that maybe had the ability to rock. I went to his fraternity house and scouted out the environment in which the chair would be, and took profile pictures of his ideal seating position to get started with.

   <h3>TAKING MEASUREMENTS</h3> 
   <br>     
   <p>To make the chair custom fit, Ben and I went to CATEA (Georgia Tech’s Center for Assistive Technology and Environmental Access), where we used anthropometric tools to get some precise measurements of Ben. I compiled all measurements into a reference image to keep handy throughout the process, and then vectored and laser cut a mannequin at 1:6 scale so that I could accurately build and test small scale models.

   <div class=text>
   <h3>IDEATING FORM</h3> 
   <br>     
   <p>With the anthropometric data all worked out, I began to focus on aesthetics. Keeping in mind the limitations set by the size and amount of wood, as well as the lack of glue and screws, I came up with a little over a dozen possible designs. From there I ruled out some chairs based on practicality, feasibility, and others on comfort. I ended up settling on a combination of the second and third drawings, keeping the slat formation of the second drawing and the curved shape of the third. This option also allowed for the possibility of rocking, which was a plus for Ben.

   <h3>CHOOSING THE FORM</h3> 
   <br>     
   <p>From the combination of the designs that I chose, I mocked up a few scaled models. The mockup of the chair turned out to not be optimal for Ben’s actual proportions, as his lower back was not completely supported, and his calves hung off the edge of the chair. Thus, I had to make some changes. I placed the scale model in Ben’s ideal position, and drew one master contour line that the model needed to follow, and applied that shape to my design to get my final form.

   <h3>PLANNING FOR ROUGH MODEL</h3> 
   <br>     
   <p>The basic structural concept I had chosen for the chair was two sets of two back “spines” that would sit on the floor, and support slats that would be laid into notches on the spines. I took this concept and my measurements from CATEA, along with Ben's preferences and the lessons that I learned from the small-scale models to create a set of orthographics that I could use to guide my construction. I also created two curved templates out of foamcore to help mark the wood for cutting.

   <div class=text>
   <h3>THE ROUGH MODEL</h3> 
   <br>     
   <p>I did not have access to a jigsaw or a table saw for this model, so I had to use a reciprocating saw for nearly the entire process. This prevented my cuts from being perfectly straight or accurate, and the rough wood made many of my cuts splinter. However, the biggest issue was that I did not properly plan out the weight distribution of the chair, so it would not stand upright. Upon I finishing the rough model, I knew that some major design modifications would be needed for the final.

   <div class=text>
   <h3>REFINING FORM</h3> 
   <br>     
   <p>To make the chair actually stand up, I sat back down and hashed out different ideas for the rear supports. I decided I’d have to give up some of its ability to rock, but the chair standing up was obviously more important. I eventually settled upon the second to last design as seen below. I then had Ben sit back down in the rough model and confirm the ideal angle of reclining, and then I designed the support according to that angle. I translated the new design back on to a template, and got ready for final construction.

   <div class=text>
   <h3>CONSTRUCTING THE FINAL MODEL</h3> 
   <br>     
   <p>With access to a jigsaw and a table saw, construction of the final draft was much more precise. I traced the templates onto the wood, and used the jigsaw to cut out the 4 ribs and the contour of the slats, and then cut the slats straight through with a table saw. To assemble everything, I clamped the ribs in place while I laid the slats on them, and doweled the loose pieces on the top and bottom. I then added a carrying handle on the back, and sanded each slat to be rounded on the edges and smooth to the touch.

   <p>Ben was very pleased with how the chair turned out. He gave positive feedback on the 
dimensions of the chair, saying that it was well sized and very comfortable. He expressed that he was concerned that the slats would be loose, and that the chair would be unstable after seeing the issues with the rough model. However, upon sitting in the final model, he was very happy with how stable, comfortable, and stationary the chair was. He also commented on how some of the thinner slats would bend slightly when he sat on them, creating an “engulfing” feeling that he really liked. All in all, he was very happy with the chair, and said that it met all of his needs.

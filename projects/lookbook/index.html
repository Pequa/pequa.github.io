    <h2>BEFORE: EMAILS NEED A PLACE TO LAND</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>A main issue with our old accessories browser was the format. The accessories page asked for fitment, then displayed every matching product on the same page, haphazardly grouped into categories. This meant that when sending out a marketing email, a link either could land on a page with every single matching accessory the brand makes, or a single product page, no in-between. And on top of this, the page was pretty bland and didn’t market any of the accessories very well.</p>

    <h2>THE LANDING STRIP</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>To solve this, I re-formatted the categories so that each category and subcategory had their own lading page. Now a “Touareg Floor Mats” email links to a page containing all the Touareg floor mats, not ALL of the accessories that fit the Touareg, or just one specific set of floor mats. This reformatting also allows each page to have its own images, which helps market the products in that category, and its own copy, which dramatically improves SEO.</p>

    <h2>WINDOW SHOPPING</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>In re-doing the accessories experience, I had the thought that in addition to browsing by a model and/or category, people ought to be able to browse by lifestyle. Browsing by model and/or category is useful when looking for a specific part or a specific accessory, but accessories are very different from parts, and people often shop for them much more broadly and with more of an open mind. So I began to lay out a concept for grouping accessories together by lifestyle or “personality”.</p>

    <h2>CARS ARE LIKE CLOTHES</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>After some refinement, I developed the concept that became known as the “lookbook”. The idea was that you could choose the type of driver that you were, and then see a selection of accessories for your car that fit that lifestyle - not unlike browsing clothes by outfit. For instance, someone that went off-roading on the weekends could choose the “off-roader” lookbook package, and that would outfit their car with accessories that fit that “look”, like mud guards, floor mats, and running boards. The idea proposed a new way to create and sell groups of products together, which had a lot of potential for manufacturers, so we ran with it.</p>

    <h2>A SAMPLE OF MY WORK</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The first “lookbook” concept that I designed for Volkswagen was incredibly well-received, and many of our other manufacturers requested that we create similar experiences for them. Brands are very excited about this new way of looking at accessories, and the concept has been widely successful as a whole. As we develop it further, the concept is continuing to grow, but it has been a large selling point for our platform in recent months. Click on the thumbnails to see an interactive prototype I made for each manufacturer. <br><br> (The prototypes are rather large, so it may be helpful to give them a minute to load.)</p>

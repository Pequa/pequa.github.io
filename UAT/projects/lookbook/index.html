    <h2>BEFORE: ONE LIST FITS ALL</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>When I first started at SimplePart, the accessories catalogs on our sites essentially involved a very lightweight page that prompted you to select your vehicle, and would then direct you to an extremely long, slow page that listed every possible accessory with minimal organization and merchandising. There were multiple problems that arose from this layout, which I aimed to solve with the improvements below. </p>

    <h2>AFTER: DESIGNED FOR MARKETING</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The most obvious problem with the structure of our old page was that it did a very poor job marketing and selling accessories. Our parts pages are very utilitarian, which is appropriate for the use case of a DIY mechanic needing a specific part. However, we were treating accessories the same way; when in reality the users of those pages are mostly new vehicle owners shopping for additions to their car, not looking for anything specific. So the first change to make was to increase the amount of marketing material: large hero images, blocks of marketing copy, category descriptions, and the like.</p>

    <div class="text">    
    <h2>AFTER: RESTRUCTURED RESULTS</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Another major, but less visible, problem with having everything listed out on one long page was that email marketing and SEM didn't have a good place to link customers to. For example, sending an email about a sale on floor mats would, at best, have to link to the floor mat section in the middle of product list. After the redesign, each model, category, and subcategory had their own page, with their own hero and marketing text. This not only allowed us to start better marketing specific models and categories, but it positively impacted SEO as well.</p>

    <h2>MARKETING A LIFESTYLE</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Thinking further on how our accessories shoppers used our sites, I came up with an idea alongside the redesign of our accessories pages. In shopping for clothes, I've always liked seeing products as parts of outfits; showing what products go well together is helpful to me. I thought, why should this be any different for cars? So I made some rough concept mockups of what became known as the "lookbook". The idea was that an owner could browse accessories for their car grouped and based around their lifestyle. If you just bought a Jetta and were interested in skiing, you could browse that "look" to find ski racks, and all-weather floor mats, everything you need to go skiing in your new car.</p>

    <h2>EVOLVING THE LOOKBOOK</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The lookbook proved to be a great addition to browsing accessories, no longer limiting users to just traditional model and category browsing. Over the next few years, the design and functionality of the lookbook improved and evolved as other team members contributed and clients provided feedback. Multiple manufacturers have even sent over spreadsheets of products and looks they wanted to make for their cars, and have even requested features that would help their dealers use it in-dealership as a point-of-purchase tool.</p>

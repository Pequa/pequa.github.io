    <h2>A MODDER’S DILEMMA</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Modifying cars is an ever-growing culture within many automotive brand communities, and jumping into it can come with a lot of uncertainty. If you want to modify your car, it can be hard to visualize how new parts will look when installed, making it difficult to confidently design the look of your car and/or explore different possibilities. Getting feedback on your design can be a challenge as well, especially before you’ve paid for and installed the parts. To help solve this problem, for my senior capstone project at Georgia Tech, I created Glimpse: a place to connect to a modding community and a platform to preview mods on your current car.</p>

    <h2>FILLING YOUR GARAGE</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>You can start with Glimpse by creating a profile and adding your current car to your garage. Your garage is a home base for your build, making it easy for people to see what your car currently looks like, and a great place to show off everything you’ve done so far. You can add any mods you currently have, have a record of your performance stats, photos, and even describe the history with your car.</p>

    <h2>CONNECTING TO THE COMMUNITY</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>In order to get feedback on designs, or even just to ask technical questions of people who own similar cars, Glimpse connects you to a community of fellow modders and provides a platform to interact with them. You can add friends and ask their opinions on your mods, give your opinion on theirs, view their garage, keep up with what mods they’ve recently installed, and even see what local events the community is putting on, as well as get inspiration from highlighted builds from across the community.</p>

    <h2>MAKING IT YOURS</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Previewing mods or designs doesn’t mean much unless you’re seeing the changes on your actual car. To achieve this, Glimpse records with your phone’s camera as you walk around the perimeter of your car, and uses the data to “scan” your car in to the app. From there, it creates a 360° interactive view of your car within the app so you can start tinkering from every angle.</p>

    <h2>TAKING A GLIMPSE</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>With your car imported into the app, you can use Glimpse to start previewing potential changes right on your phone without actually having to purchase and install the parts. You can preview different paint colors, vinyls and decals, wheels, and even see how performance mods will affect your stats. Glimpse allows you to create infinite combinations, allowing you to find the one that's right for you and your build. After that, you can post your Glimpse to the community and get other opinions, and when you're finally ready, integrated shopping within the app allows you to buy the parts that you used in your preview, letting you turn your preview into reality.</p>

    <h2>BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>After concepting the functionality above and designing each of the features and their respective screens, I used (the then still in beta) Adobe XD to bring everything together into one cohesive, online flow. The final prototype was then able to be interacted with on a phone (a pretty new feature at the time), making the final concept look more realistic and adding an element of tangibility to the review. My capstone presentation received a tremendous amount of positive feedback from reviewers, with comments saying that Glimpse married the beauty of Photoshop to Instagram.</p>

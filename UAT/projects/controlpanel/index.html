    <h2>ORDER MANAGEMENT: ITERATING DESIGN</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>One of the most-used screens in our dealer-facing control panel was also likely the most out of date. In many places, the styling of our control panel is out of date in general; so when it came time for redesign, we started with our most-used screen: order management. The previous design was extremely utilitarian and not very user-friendly, however some of our large-volume dealers liked it this way. The challenge for this redesign was to give the majority of our average users the ability to do everything they would need to not only easily manage, but also fulfill, recent orders, while still catering to our high-volume power users.</p>

    <h2>ORDER MANAGEMENT: FINALIZING FUNCTIONALITY</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>After many iterations and multiple rounds of dealer testing and feedback, I finalized a design that suited the needs of our inexperienced users as well as our power users. It was a drastic change from the previous order management screen, but provided a large amount of new functionality, as well as served as the basis for a new design language that we could carry forward into the rest of the control panel. Users are now able to view order contents, warehouse inventory, fraud warnings, email correspondence, and more, as well as even set their own custom workflows that suit their parts team’s needs.</p>

    <h2>CATALOG MANAGEMENT: EXPLORING NAVIGATION</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Another set of screens in our control panel that we began to redesign were those involving catalog management. These screens allow clients to manage their product catalog, including setting product information, pricing, sale information, and more. Because there are many separate “sub-functions” of the catalog management screen, this prompted me to re-think the navigation of how our control panel was laid out. I spent multiple iterations exploring how headers and subheaders could be used to clearly define and separate different parts of the catalog screens, and the control panel as a whole.</p>

    <h2>CATALOG MANAGEMENT: PERFECTING LAYOUT</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The order management page redesign involved a lot of building form around function. The lighter-weight catalog management screen (that are similar in weight to many of our other control panel screens) was the first opportunity to define the form and layout that would carry over to the majority of the control panel. A lot of ideation and effort went into not only designing this screen, but designing it in a way that could be usefully inherited by other current and future screens in our control panel.</p>

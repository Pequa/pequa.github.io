    <h2>PORTING THE SITE TO SHOPIFY</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>My work with Obsessed Garage began with porting their existing site from their previous e-commerce platform over to Shopify. Matt had founded the Obsessed Garage brand to promote and sell his favorite automotive detailing and garage products, and as his business was rapidly growing, needed a better e-commerce platform to handle increased volume. My first project involved moving their product catalog over into Shopify's CMS, recreating existing pages in their Shopify template, as well as designing and custom coding Matt's car and garage pages on the site as well.</p>

    <h2>DESIGNING NEW PAGES, DEVELOPING NEW FEATURES</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>As the Obsessed Garage brand continued to grow and Matt's team expanded, I regularly took on projects to design and implement new pages and features on the site. This included everything from simple features through app integrations, to custom features that were not easily available that I end up coding myself. More recently, Obsessed Garage hired an in-house designer, so I have been taking on more development-heavy projects and leaving the lighter-weight design work to their team.</p>

    <h2>MANAGING THE TEMPLATE, WORKING AROUND IT</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Shopify's template system is great for simple sites that need little customization beyond what your template offers, which I have utilized for many projects on Obsessed Garage. However, it becomes challenging when custom features or elements are requested that the template doesn't offer. And since the catalog is constantly changing with products and categories being added or removed, hard-coding things is often not possible. Because of this, a lot of the custom work I have done for Obsessed Garage has involved using Shopify's Liquid language to dynamically pull back product lists, snippets, etc. so the solutions can work in any setting with any variables.</p>

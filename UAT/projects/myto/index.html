    <h2>INITIAL CONCEPTS</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>This project served as in introduction to ergonomic 3D printing, with the final product being to 3D print a ring out of metal. To begin, I hashed out ten different potential deigns, focusing on ones that could take advantage of this medium of production.</p>

    <h2>REFINING THE PATTERN</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Although I thought many of the forms had potential, the “mitochondria” ring stood out as a frontrunner, and to me it also illustrated a form that would be difficult to produce with a method other than 3D printing. I decided to pursue that concept as a form, and began ideating the design of the cross-section to give me a starting point for the 3D model.</p>

    <h2>CREATING THE MODEL</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>For each new cross-section I created, I extruded the path in SolidWorks so I could visualize the form in 3D, and then printed a rough model to see how it looked on the finger. I played with different heights, widths, and diameters to see which dimensions looked and felt best as a ring. After perfecting the dimensions and adding some aesthetic details, I arrived at an ideal form, of which I made one final model. I then sent the ring off to Shapeways to be 3D printed in stainless steel.</p>

    <h2>RENDERING & CREATING THE FAMILY</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>While the ring was being printed, I focused on the branding of the ring, out of which the MYTO brand was born. I liked a few of the other ideations of MYTO that I had created along the way, so I decided to create a family of rings that varied slightly, but had the same mitochondria-esque feel to them.</p>

    <h2>THE POSTER</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Once I had finished the branding of the family and the ring had been delivered and photographed, I created a brand poster to exhibit the look and feel of the product line. The poster showcases the final printed ring, as well as renderings of all three of the rings that would be available.</p>

    <h2>THE FINAL PRODUCT</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The ring received positive feedback on the design, however the print quality of the metal was a bit grittier than I had expected. Another option from Shapeways involved the ring being 3D printed out of wax and then cast in metal, which would have produced a smoother result. However, I was pleased having something that was actually 3D printed in metal, showcasing the impressive manufacturing process.</p>

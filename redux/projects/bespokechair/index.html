    <h2>ANALYZING NEEDS</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>This project was to design and build a chair that was custom made for our partner. We were only allowed to use a single 5'x8' sheet of half-inch plywood, and were not allowed to use any fasteners or glue. My partner, Ben, wanted a gaming-style chair that was low to the floor, comfortable, and that maybe had the ability to rock. I began by observing and recording his ideal seating position.</p>

    <h2>TAKING MEASUREMENTS</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>To make the chair custom fit, Ben and I went to CATEA (Georgia Tech’s Center for Assistive Technology and Environmental Access), where we used anthropometric tools to get precise measurements of Ben. After measuring, I vectored and laser cut a 1:6 mannequin so that I could test small scale models.</p>

    <h2>IDEATING FORMS</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Keeping in mind the limitations set by the amount of wood and the lack of fasteners, I came up with thirteen possible designs. From there I ruled out different chairs based on practicality, feasibility, and comfort. I ended up settling on a combination of the second and third drawings above.</p>

    <h2>CHOOSING THE FORM</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I mocked up a few scale models, which turned out to not be optimal or comfortable for Ben’s actual proportions. I placed the scale model in Ben’s ideal position, and drew one master contour line that the model needed to follow, and applied that shape to my design to obtain my final form.</p>

    <h2>PLANNING THE ROUGH MODEL</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I took the lessons I learned from the small-scale model and the measurements from CATEA, along with Ben's preferences, to create a set of orthographics that I could use to guide my construction. Im addition, I created two curved templates out of foamcore to help mark the wood for cutting.</p>

    <h2>THE ROUGH MODEL</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I did not have access to a jigsaw for this model, so I had to use a reciprocating saw for nearly the entire process. This, along with rough wood, led to a really rough model. However, the biggest issue was that I did not properly plan out the weight distribution of the chair, so it would not stand upright.</p>

    <h2>REFINING FORM</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>To make the chair stand up, I sat back down and laid out ideas for the rear supports. I decided I’d have to give up the ability to rock, but the chair standing up was obviously more important. After choosing the supports, I had Ben sit back down in the rough model and confirm the angle of reclining, then translated the new design back on to a template.</p>

    <h2>CONSTRUCTING THE FINAL MODEL</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>With access to a jigsaw and a table saw, construction of the final draft was much more precise. I traced the templates onto the wood, cut out the four ribs and the slats, and assembled it from there, then doweled the loose pieces on the top and bottom. Finally, I finished by sanding it.</p>

    <div class="text"><h3>THE BESPOKE CHAIR</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Ben was very pleased with how the chair turned out. He gave positive feedback on the dimensions of the chair, saying it was properly sized and very comfortable. He also commented on how some of the thinner slats would bend slightly when he sat on them, creating an “engulfing” feeling that he really liked.    </p>

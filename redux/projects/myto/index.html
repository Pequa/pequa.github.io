    <h2>INITIAL CONCEPTS</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>This project served as in introduction to 3D printing to fit the body, and its end goal was to 3D print a ring out of metal. To begin, we were to come up with ten different deigns, focusing on those that could take advantage of this medium of production.</p>

    <h2>REFINING THE PATTERN</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Although I really liked many of the forms, the “mitochondria” ring best illustrated a ring that would be very hard to make with any method other than 3D printing, so I decided to pursue that one. I started ideating the proportions of the cross-section to give me a starting point for a 3D model.</p>

    <h2>CREATING THE MODEL</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Each new cross-section I created, I extruded in SolidWorks so that I could visualize the form in 3D, and then printed a model to see how it looked on the finger. I played with different heights, widths, and diameters to see which dimensions worked best as a ring.</p>

    <h2>FINISHING THE MODEL</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>After getting the dimensions perfected and adding some other aesthetic changes, finally I arrived at an ideal form for which I made one last refined model. I then sent the ring off to Shapeways to be 3D printed in stainless steel.</p>

    <h2>RENDERING & CREATING THE FAMILY</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>While the ring was being printed, I focused on the branding of the ring, and thus the MYTO brand was born. I decided that I liked a few of the other ideations of MYTO that I had created along the way, so I decided to create a family of rings that varied slightly, but had the same mitochondria feel to them. (Due to technical difficulties I could not get these printed in time).</p>

    <h2>THE POSTER</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Once I got the branding finished and the ring back and photographed, I created a brand poster to show the personality of the product line. The poster showcases the ring that I got printed, as well as renderings of all the rings that would be available. </p>

    <div class="text"><h3>MYTO RING</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The ring recieved postitve feedback on the design, however the print quality of the metal was a bit grittier than I would have liked. Other options from Shapeways involved the ring being 3D printed out of wax and then cast in metal and would have produced a smoother result, which I perhaps should have done. But on the other hand, I like having something that was actually 3D printed in metal, and was happy with the result.</p>
